# Algorithm
People often confuse the terms ‘algorithm’ and statistical model. A statistical model is an application of something like regression to a particular problem. An algorithm is typically a computer science concept related to things like how to sort a very large list or random numbers (e.g., bubble sort) or a generalized procedure that is applied to data (e.g., random forest). This confusion is acceptable from the client but not so much for a job applicant.

# ATE
Average treatment effect, or the expected impact of an intervention across an entire group as calculated from an experiment.

# AUCROC
AUC = area under the curve. ROC = receiver operating curve. Popular accuracy metric for models, demonstrates how well your model rank-orders. 

# AWS
Amazon Web Services, one of the most popular cloud providers. They let you do things like rent servers and databases.

# Base Voter
A person who always votes and always votes for the candidate or issue at hand. This person should be recruited to volunteer or to give money to the campaign.

# Redshift
Often in the context of Amazon Redshift. A popular database option. Also when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength, or shifted to the red end of the spectrum. (NOTE:  There are a non-trivial number of physicists in this field.)

# Support Score
Individual-level score from 0-100 predicting likelihood of voting for a Democrat

# Topline
Same thing as horserace. Also called "the initial." or the “head-to-head.”

# Turnout Score
Individual-level score from 0-100 predicting likelihood of turning out in an election

# Undecideds
