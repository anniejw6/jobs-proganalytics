<p>First, a quick lesson on campaign finance---though I should point out that I&#x2019;m not a lawyer and this explanation of campaign finance is roughly as nuanced/accurate a description of the topic as <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyeJ55o3El0" target="_blank">I&#x2019;m Just a Bill</a></em> is of our legislative process. </p>
<p>So in any given election, you have the candidate and the independent expenditures. The candidate side (&quot;Coordinated Campaign&quot;) can work with the Democratic Party (national and state levels) to organize field work, messaging, policy, etc.  The independent expenditures (&#x201C;IE&#x201D;) side can&#x2019;t coordinate with the candidate or the party and instead operates on its own. (NOTE:  These two groups are separated by a legal construction called a &#x201C;firewall&#x201D;. The IE and coordinated groups on either side of the firewall. Various individuals can also be above or below the firewall. (Yes, it&#x2019;s a weird wall.) Also, sometimes IE groups can coordinate with coordinated groups, with exceptions varying by state and by race (e.g., federal vs. state). )  The IE side often will include three categories of organizations: Super PACs and other advocacy groups (e.g., environmental groups, labor unions, women&#x2019;s rights groups); non-partisan groups (e.g., Rock the Vote); and Party IE organizations (an IE group funded and staffed by the party). Each of these three categories can only coordinate within themselves and none of them can coordinate with the candidate or the party. (Confused? It&#x2019;s okay --- there&#x2019;s a reason you&#x2019;re not in law school.)<sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>You might ask what the difference is between work that happens on the coordinated side, and work that happens on the IE side.  The answer is that it&#x2019;s complicated.  On the IE side, you have groups like Patriot Majority PAC, which exist to raise and spend money on paid communication like TV advertising.  Other IE groups include membership organizations like Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood, which run a mix of direct voter outreach and paid communication programs.  Finally, there is organized labor, which runs primarily field-based member-to-member programs and general voter outreach. These organizations are often coordinated through America Votes, which has its own in-house data management capacity. The coordinated side tends to be more associated with direct voter contact activities, such as canvassing and phone banking.  However, even candidate campaigns may often allocate the majority of their expenditures to TV advertising. </p>
<p>In terms of analytics, almost every major organization will have access to some sort of data and analytics capacity. Many organizations will have in-house &quot;data&quot; staff, who manage the inflow and outflow of data. Some coordinated campaigns will also have in-house analytics team, e.g. Hillary for America or the DNC. Most campaigns won&#x2019;t be able to support a team of that size or scope; instead, they&#x2019;ll rely on other (larger) campaigns or analytics consultants to provide what they need. On the IE side, many organizations don&apos;t have their own analytics team, although some of the larger ones will. One of the best/most established analytics operations on the IE side (really, in the entire community) is the AFL-CIO Analytics Team, who often provides core analytics services for much of the organized labor community. </p>
<p>When organizations don&#x2019;t have an in-house analytics team, they&#x2019;ll often turn to outside consultants. These consultants often come out of campaigns and, in theory, offer lower hours and higher pay than directly working for a candidate/campaign (at the cost of access). There are a host of analytics consultants, including but not limited to BlueLabs, Civis, Clarity Campaign Labs, HaystaqDNA, and Minerva Insights.<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup> Some of these consultants are more focused on left-leaning politics, but almost everyone will do some degree of corporate or otherwise non-political work to tide themselves over between elections. Methodologically, most of these organizations provide predictive modeling and strategy. On the experimental side, the progressive movement has the Analyst Institute, which conducts and disseminates research related to tactical strategy and serves as a central hub for meetings between practitioners (i.e., people who implement campaigns and other programs in the field) and analysts. All of these consultants will work in concert with strategy pollsters in order to provide information for campaigns.</p>
<p><sup><a href="#fn_1" id="reffn_1">1</a></sup> In all seriousness, I have no idea why this is so complicated. If a lawyer wants to explain this to me, that&#x2019;d be great.
<sup><a href="#fn_2" id="reffn_2">2</a></sup> These organizations pop up after every election, and I expect that more firms will get started after 2016.</p>

You’re entering a world of people who you won’t be sure are crazy or brilliant or both. You are in for long days and short deadlines. You will meet some of your closest friends, and there will be times when you will want to strangle them out of stress and sleep-deprivation. Your job will be at turns tedious, overwhelming, and insanely hard. You will learn new skills out of necessity, and at multiple times during an election season, you will ask yourself, \"Who in their right mind is letting me doing this?\" (NOTE:  A friend of mine described working in politics as “the only place in the world in which young people are given so much responsibility.” And while he meant “young” in the literal sense, it’s true more broadly. People with limited experience in this field will be given enormous responsibility as soon as they prove themselves.) Above all, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are using your skills and talent to make the world a better place, whether your passion is reducing racial and economic inequality, promoting women’s rights, protecting the environment, advancing LGBTQ policies, defending communities of color, or something else entirely. Welcome, we’re glad you’re here.","styles":{"website":"styles/website.css","pdf":"styles/pdf.css","epub":"styles/epub.css","mobi":"styles/mobi.css","ebook":"styles/ebook.css","print":"styles/print.css"}},"file":{"path":"content/02a_players.md","mtime":"2016-04-29T02:38:41.000Z","type":"markdown"},"gitbook":{"version":"3.0.0-pre.9","time":"2016-04-29T02:50:51.764Z","generator":"website"},"basePath":"..","book":{}});
