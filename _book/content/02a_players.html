<p>You might ask what the difference is between work that happens on the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#coordinated" class="glossary-term" title="Sometimes shortened to &quot;coord&quot;, this term refers to the coordinated part of a campaign (candidate + party) as opposed to the independent expenditures side.

Usually includes advocacy groups and Super PACs.">IE</a> side.  The answer is that it&#x2019;s complicated.  On the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#ie" class="glossary-term" title="Short for independent expenditures, refers to the side of the campaign that is independent of the campaign. Usually includes advocacy groups and Super PACs.">IE</a> side, you have groups like Patriot Majority PAC, which exist to raise and spend money on paid communication like TV advertising.  Other <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#ie" class="glossary-term" title="Short for independent expenditures, refers to the side of the campaign that is independent of the campaign. Usually includes advocacy groups and Super PACs.">IE</a> groups include membership organizations like Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood, which run a mix of direct voter outreach and paid communication programs.  Finally, there is organized labor, which runs primarily field-based member-to-member programs and general voter outreach. These organizations are often <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#coordinated" class="glossary-term" title="Sometimes shortened to &quot;coord&quot;, this term refers to the coordinated part of a campaign (candidate + party) as opposed to the independent expenditures side. ">coordinated</a> through America Votes, which has its own in-house data management capacity. The <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#coordinated" class="glossary-term" title="Sometimes shortened to &quot;coord&quot;, this term refers to the coordinated part of a campaign (candidate + party) as opposed to the independent expenditures side. ">coordinated</a> side tends to be more associated with direct voter contact activities, such as canvassing and phone banking.  However, even candidate campaigns may often allocate the majority of their expenditures to TV advertising. </p>
<p>In terms of analytics, almost every major organization will have access to some sort of data and analytics capacity. Many organizations will have in-house &quot;data&quot; staff, who manage the inflow and outflow of data. Some <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#coordinated" class="glossary-term" title="Sometimes shortened to &quot;coord&quot;, this term refers to the coordinated part of a campaign (candidate + party) as opposed to the independent expenditures side. ">coordinated</a> campaigns will also have in-house analytics team, e.g. Hillary for America or the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#dnc" class="glossary-term" title="Democratic National Committee">DNC</a>. Most campaigns won&#x2019;t be able to support a team of that size or scope; instead, they&#x2019;ll rely on other (larger) campaigns or analytics consultants to provide what they need. On the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#ie" class="glossary-term" title="Short for independent expenditures, refers to the side of the campaign that is independent of the campaign. Usually includes advocacy groups and Super PACs.">IE</a> side, many organizations don&apos;t have their own analytics team, although some of the larger ones will. One of the best/most established analytics operations on the <a href="../GLOSSARY.html#ie" class="glossary-term" title="Short for independent expenditures, refers to the side of the campaign that is independent of the campaign. Usually includes advocacy groups and Super PACs.">IE</a> side (really, in the entire community) is the AFL-CIO Analytics Team, who often provides core analytics services for much of the organized labor community. </p>
<p>When organizations don&#x2019;t have an in-house analytics team, they&#x2019;ll often turn to outside consultants. These consultants often come out of campaigns and, in theory, offer lower hours and higher pay than directly working for a candidate/campaign (at the cost of access). There are a host of analytics consultants, including but not limited to BlueLabs, Civis, Clarity Campaign Labs, HaystaqDNA, and Minerva Insights.<sup><a href="#fn_3" id="reffn_3">3</a></sup> Some of these consultants are more focused on left-leaning politics, but almost everyone will do some degree of corporate or otherwise non-political work to tide themselves over between elections. Methodologically, most of these organizations provide predictive modeling and strategy. On the experimental side, the progressive movement has the Analyst Institute, which conducts and disseminates research related to tactical strategy and serves as a central hub for meetings between practitioners (i.e., people who implement campaigns and other programs in the field) and analysts. All of these consultants will work in concert with strategy pollsters in order to provide information for campaigns.</p>
