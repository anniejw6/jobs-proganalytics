<p>People often confuse the terms &#x2018;algorithm&#x2019; and statistical model. A statistical model is an application of something like regression to a particular problem. An algorithm is typically a computer science concept related to things like how to sort a very large list or random numbers (e.g., bubble sort) or a generalized procedure that is applied to data (e.g., random forest). This confusion is acceptable from the client but not so much for a job applicant.</p>
<h1 id="ate">ATE</h1>
<p>Average treatment effect, or the expected impact of an intervention across an entire group as calculated from an experiment.</p>
<h1 id="aucroc">AUCROC</h1>
<p>AUC = area under the curve. ROC = receiver operating curve. Popular accuracy metric for models, demonstrates how well your model rank-orders. </p>

<h1 id="coordinated">Coordinated</h1>
<p>Sometimes shortened to &quot;coord&quot;, this term refers to the coordinated part of a campaign (candidate + party) as opposed to the independent expenditures side. </p>
<h1 id="db">DB</h1>
<p>Short for database.</p>
<h1 id="dga">DGA</h1>

<p>The legal construction preventing folks working on the coordinated and independent expenditures side of the same race from talking to each other/sharing strategic information</p>
<h1 id="gotv">GOTV</h1>
<p>Get out the vote. Or the last few days of the campaign when you are furiously trying to get your supporters to vote.</p>
<h1 id="hfa">HFA</h1>
<p>Hillary for America (as in, the Clinton presidential campaign)</p>
<h1 id="horserace">Horserace</h1>

<h1 id="hrc">HRC</h1>
<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton. Sometimes also Human Rights Campaign.</p>
<h1 id="ie">IE</h1>
<p>Short for independent expenditures, refers to the side of the campaign that is independent of the campaign. Usually includes advocacy groups and Super PACs.</p>
<h1 id="io">IO</h1>

<h1 id="model">Model</h1>

You’re entering a world of people who you won’t be sure are crazy or brilliant or both. You are in for long days and short deadlines. You will meet some of your closest friends, and there will be times when you will want to strangle them out of stress and sleep-deprivation. Your job will be at turns tedious, overwhelming, and insanely hard. You will learn new skills out of necessity, and at multiple times during an election season, you will ask yourself, \"Who in their right mind is letting me doing this?\"1 Above all, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are using your skills and talent to make the world a better place, whether your passion is reducing racial and economic inequality, promoting women’s rights, protecting the environment, advancing LGBTQ policies, defending communities of color, or something else entirely.
