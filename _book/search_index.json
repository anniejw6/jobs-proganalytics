The label &quot;progressive politics&quot; encompasses a wide variety of groups and individuals that are trying to promote progressive ideas, values, laws, and candidates. The term progressive often describes organizations aligned with the Democratic Party, but this doesn&#x2019;t necessarily have to be the case. Types of organizations active in progressive politics include candidate campaigns, party committees, labor unions, advocacy organizations, and consulting firms. What these organizations have in common is that they are engaging in a set of actions to promote a policy,  a set of policies, or a candidate. Some campaigns only last for an election cycle (e.g., a presidential campaign) while others will last for decades (e.g., organized labor, some environmental groups). \nThere are lots of parts to a campaign: fundraising, policy, communications, field organizing, opposition research, digital strategy, etc. All of these parts serve the campaign&#x2019;s goals, whether that is electing a candidate, getting a legislator to vote a particular way on a ball, or raise money to fund a voter registration drive. Progressive political candidates generally have a variety of possible tactics at their disposal: from buying television ads to engaging on social media to sending volunteers out to knock on doors to remind supporters to vote. The goal of analytics work is to optimize these particular tactics in order to help achieve whatever goal it is.\nRelative to other components of campaigns, analytics is a recent addition, arising in either the late 1990s or early 2000s, depending on whom you ask.1Analytics is both related to yet distinct from polling, which has been a feature of American politics since the 1950s, but we&#x2019;ll get back to this point later.\nThe basic assumption of analytics is that we can observe things about the world, and that those observations should inform our decisions. Analytics practitioners are responsible for producing the ground truth, so that campaign leadership can make sound decisions around resource allocations: what geographic areas should receive more funding? What tactics should a campaign spend its money on? Which individuals should campaigns try to mobilize or persuade? How many volunteers do we need? How do we use their time? The ultimate goal of analytics is optimization, gaining the maximum impact given a limited set of resources. \nOne of the biggest functions of progressive analytics is to optimize voter outreach, and at the heart of that effort is the voter file, a list of every registered voter in the United States along with their name, address, phone number, and previous vote history (whether or not they voted, not whom they voted for). This data is actually publically available, sometimes for free and sometimes for a fee.2 Sometimes, this data is appended with commercial datasets, which adds records of unregistered voters. Data providers will also add columns to this voter file through other sources, ranging from Census data to datasets of commercial activity. At the end of it, we end with dozens to hundreds of characteristics (often called features) on any given individual.3\nWithin an organization, there are two types of people who will interact with the data: on one end of the spectrum are data managers, whose primary role is to make sure that the data is clean and up-to-date, and on the other end are analysts, whose primary role is to actually use statistical analysis to draw insights from the data. In practice, many junior analysts and data managers will have overlapping duties and roles.4 Both of these groups can drive campaign strategy: data managers will often be more &quot;on the ground&quot;, interacting directly with field organizers who are using the data to identify and target voters and reporting on their results, while analysts tend to be clustered at headquarters, where they may do more abstract analyses like analyzing polls or building the tools used by data managers for targeting.\nThe ultimate goal of all of this data is to optimize resource allocation. For example, we might have a limited number of volunteers, so we want to make sure that we send those volunteers to the voters for whom they will be most impact. In the world before voter files, we would allocate resources at the precinct or even county level, prioritizing counties with higher percentages of target voters. But even then, the percentage of target voters will never be 100%, which means that at least some resources are being used sub-optimally.\nIn order to increase efficiency, analytics practitioners will often try to optimize resources at the individual rather than county or precinct level. The way that they do this is through modeling, which uses the voter file to generate individual-level scores ranging from 0-100 (called models) to predict things like the likelihood of turning out to vote or the likelihood of voting for a Democrat. Then, they can use these scores to target which voters to reach out to encourage to vote (often called get out the vote or GOTV, or which ones to target for persuasion efforts. By using these individual-level scores, you don&#x2019;t have to target particular counties or precincts: you can target only the individuals of interest. Modeling can also include election forecasting, taking in public and private polling to project out election results months in advance. \nHow do analytics practitioners know which people to target? In some cases, they can look at past behaviors, like voting. One of the biggest predictors of whether or not someone will vote in the future is whether or not they&#x2019;ve voted in the past. When it comes to predicting candidate support, through, analytics will often rely on polling. \nPolling has been a central component of campaigns since the 1950s, although polling has typically referred to strategy polling rather than analytics polling. Strategy polling refers to the tradition of pollsters being viewed as strategic partners on campaigns, guiding the development of messaging and, to a much lesser degree, targeting. Strategy pollsters typically use long surveys on small samples (i.e., 400-1000 people) to perform deep dives on the electorate. This approach enables simulating the campaign environment, complete with overlapping messages that are pro- and con- towards both the candidate and the opponent.5 The results of these polls are collected in toplines, which represent the main results, and banner books, which present cross-tabulations of the results by demographic group. Together, these tools allow pollsters to present macro-level advice about the direction of the campaign and how it should move forward.\nAnalytics polling is similar but distinct from strategy polling. Typically, analytics polls involve shorter polls and larger sample sizes.6 These poll results  often are appended to the voter file, and using these results, analysts can build predictive models of which candidates or policies that individuals are likely to support. Analytics polls are performed at regular intervals throughout the campaigns and used in modeling, election forecasting, and tracking. You&#x2019;ll generally see fewer analytics polls than strategy polls reported on in the media, both because there are fewer analytics firms and because most of their work is purchased by campaigns and IE (independent expenditure) groups directly rather than produced for public consumption. In contrast to strategy pollsters, analytics polls will rarely try to simulate a campaign environment, both to reduce the length of the poll (which increases representativeness and reduces costs) and because, philosophically, it&#x2019;s somewhat questionable about whether phone polls can actually simulate a campaign environment and accurately measure changes to it.\nObviously, the question of how to effectively change voters&#x2019; beliefs and behaviors is one of the most important questions (perhaps the most important question) of any campaign: how will voters would respond if they received some type of intervention, e.g., seeing a particular TV ad or listening to a particular message, and how many resources should a campaign allocate to those actions? But rather than simply asking people in a phone poll which message is most persuasive often isn&#x2019;t enough. The things that people identify as the most persuasive or resonant may not actually be what is persuasive, both because people like and also because persuasion can be more subtle than individuals can identify.\nAs a result, when analytics practitioners try to answer types of these questions about the effect of campaign actions, they&#x2019;ll typically run large experiments on actual voters. Just like in a medical trial, they&#x2019;ll randomly assign individuals to receive certain types of interventions and  then measure what is the impact of those interventions in order to provide strategic guidance about what types of tactics to use. These tests often take place &quot;in the field&quot;, which is to say that rather than exposing people to a message on the phone, analysts might actually try to send mail pieces to people&#x2019;s doors and then run a phone survey on people assigned and not assigned to receive mail.\nHistorically, analytics has mainly fallen into two big camps: digital and field. Digital analytics typically involves optimizing fundraising and messaging; it encompasses everything from online petition signing to the e-mail list to the Twitter feeds. Field analysts look at, well, everything else, ranging from volunteer recruitment to voter outreach.  Digital analysts often perform a lot of testing on things like messaging and layout in order to optimize behavior. Compared to other practitioners, digital analysts often see a faster turnaround time on the things that they&#x2019;re analyzing or testing. Field analysts, by contrast, are often guiding volunteer or voter outreach behavior in the &quot;real world&quot;. As a result, any tests that they run will take weeks rather than days, and they may never be able to fully measure the output of their results. The item that falls between these two groups is often media spending (think TV budgets), which can be handled by either team or sometimes another team entirely. At any rate, these are mostly organizational issues: analysts will often move back and forth to different types of analyses, but the core analytical skills will remain the same.\nIn large part because the field is so new, analytics is constantly evolving and growing. A good analytics team that is used well will touch almost every part of a campaign&#x2019;s operations. As a result, analysts rely on the work of many other teams, ranging from the technology team, who which writes software to manage databases and other workflows, to the field organizing team, which uses the models that analysts produce in order to create lists of voters (often called pulling lists) for targeting. The role of an analyst is to set up systems through a combination of programming and statistics to answer a campaign&#x2019;s key questions quickly, reliably, and at scale. \n\n1. You can buy the Pennsylvania voter file, for example, in about 15 minutes with a credit card and twenty bucks. The fee for other states ranges from free to tens of thousands of dollars. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2. There is a fashionable, but incorrect, belief that analytics started with the 2008 or 2012 Obama for America campaign. While this might have been one of the best-funded analytics operations, it certainly wasn&#x2019;t the first. FiveThirtyEight has an excellent overview on the use of data in political campaigns. &#x21A9;\n\n\n3. Okay, that was actually a fairly dramatic oversimplification of the long, messy, incredibly complicated topic of identity resolution. Voter files are actually sort of absurdly annoying to compile. Think about it: every single state has its own way of compiling information and uses different standards in doing so. People move across states all the time, and resolving duplicated entries and tracking people across time is a decidedly non-trivial task. Luckily, most analysts will never have to deal with this process, leaving it to the professionals at organizations specializing in voter-files like Catalist, TargetSmart, and the DNC. &#x21A9;\n\n\n4. This document is more focused on the analysts&#x2019; roles in campaigns, although much of the advice applies to data managers, especially at the more junior levels. &#x21A9;\n\n\n5. Most of the polls that you find in the media are from strategy polling firms. Typically, if a poll has more than 10 questions on it, you can be fairly certain that it&#x2019;s from a strategy polling firm. &#x21A9;\n\n\n6. Methodologically, both analytics and strategy polling uses voter files to draw on samples, although strategy pollsters will occasionally also use random digit dialing. In general, strategy polling tends to hew more closely to traditional, academic survey research whereas analytics pollsters tend to use more modern techniques, such as drawing samples on the basis of turnout propensity (rather than using a likely voter screen) and inversely to response likelihood. &#x21A9;\n\n"},"content/02a_players.html":{"url":"content/02a_players.html","title":"Major Players","summary":"First, a quick lesson on campaign finance---though I should point out that I’m not a lawyer and this explanation of campaign finance is roughly as nuanced/accurate a description of the topic as I’m Just a Bill is of our legislative process.

The candidate side (&quot;Coordinated Campaign&quot;) can work with the Democratic Party (national and state levels) to organize field work, messaging, policy, etc.  The independent expenditures (&#x201C;IE&#x201D;) side can&#x2019;t coordinate with the candidate or the party and instead operates on its own.1 Also, sometimes IE groups can coordinate with coordinated groups, with exceptions varying by state and by race (e.g., federal vs. state). )  The IE side often will include three categories of organizations: Super PACs and other advocacy groups (e.g., environmental groups, labor unions, women&#x2019;s rights groups); non-partisan groups (e.g., Rock the Vote); and Party IE organizations (an IE group funded and staffed by the party). Each of these three categories can only coordinate within themselves and none of them can coordinate with the candidate or the party. (Confused? It&#x2019;s okay --- there&#x2019;s a reason you&#x2019;re not in law school.)2\nYou might ask what the difference is between work that happens on the coordinated side, and work that happens on the IE side.  The answer is that it&#x2019;s complicated.  On the IE side, you have groups like Patriot Majority PAC, which exist to raise and spend money on paid communication like TV advertising.  Other IE groups include membership organizations like Sierra Club and Planned Parenthood, which run a mix of direct voter outreach and paid communication programs.  Finally, there is organized labor, which runs primarily field-based member-to-member programs and general voter outreach. These organizations are often coordinated through America Votes, which has its own in-house data management capacity. The coordinated side tends to be more associated with direct voter contact activities, such as canvassing and phone banking.  However, even candidate campaigns may often allocate the majority of their expenditures to TV advertising. \nIn terms of analytics, almost every major organization will have access to some sort of data and analytics capacity. Many organizations will have in-house &quot;data&quot; staff, who manage the inflow and outflow of data. Some coordinated campaigns will also have in-house analytics team, e.g. Hillary for America or the DNC. Most campaigns won&#x2019;t be able to support a team of that size or scope; instead, they&#x2019;ll rely on other (larger) campaigns or analytics consultants to provide what they need. On the IE side, many organizations don&apos;t have their own analytics team, although some of the larger ones will. One of the best/most established analytics operations on the IE side (really, in the entire community) is the AFL-CIO Analytics Team, who often provides core analytics services for much of the organized labor community. \nWhen organizations don&#x2019;t have an in-house analytics team, they&#x2019;ll often turn to outside consultants. These consultants often come out of campaigns and, in theory, offer lower hours and higher pay than directly working for a candidate/campaign (at the cost of access). There are a host of analytics consultants, including but not limited to BlueLabs, Civis, Clarity Campaign Labs, HaystaqDNA, and Minerva Insights.3 Some of these consultants are more focused on left-leaning politics, but almost everyone will do some degree of corporate or otherwise non-political work to tide themselves over between elections. Methodologically, most of these organizations provide predictive modeling and strategy. On the experimental side, the progressive movement has the Analyst Institute, which conducts and disseminates research related to tactical strategy and serves as a central hub for meetings between practitioners (i.e., people who implement campaigns and other programs in the field) and analysts. All of these consultants will work in concert with strategy pollsters in order to provide information for campaigns.\n\n1. These two groups are separated by a legal construction called a &#x201C;firewall&#x201D;. The IE and coordinated groups on either side of the firewall. Various individuals can also be above or below the firewall. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2. In all seriousness, I have no idea why this is so complicated. If a lawyer wants to explain this to me, that&#x2019;d be great. &#x21A9;\n\n\n3. These organizations pop up after every election, and I expect that more firms will get started after 2016. &#x21A9;\n\n"},"content/02b_career.html":{"url":"content/02b_career.html","title":"Career Paths","summary":"Honestly, analytics is so new that there aren’t well-established career tracks. I’m broadly categorizing analytics jobs into three tiers:","body":"What does my career trajectory look like?\nHonestly, analytics is so new that there aren&#x2019;t well-established career tracks. I&#x2019;m broadly categorizing analytics jobs into three tiers:\n\nJunior Analyst or Data Manager: You just entered the field. You are responsible for things like preparing and cleaning data. You conduct analyses under close guidance and supervision from others. Data managers typically rely less heavily on statistics than junior analysts, and the technical requirements for data managers are often lower than analysts. There are also far more data managers than analysts in progressive politics. Salaries at this level typically range between $40-$65k.\n\nSenior Analyst: You&#x2019;ve probably worked for one to two cycles. You supervise the work of junior analysts and conduct new analyses on your own. At this point, you should be comfortable coding large-scale projects and developing your own body of work. Salaries at this level typically range between $55-$80k.\n\nAnalytics Manager: You manage a team of two or more analysts at once. You are responsible for the work coming out of your team. You participate in senior-level discussions. Salaries at this level are $75k+.\n\n\nPeople switch in and out of this trajectory at any level, and people hop out of progressive analytics at pretty regular intervals to go into other roles at progressive organizations, graduate school/academia, or (increasingly) the private sector. In addition, folks might specialize at any level of this trajectory, e.g. specialize in modeling, experimentation, polling, or something else. If you&#x2019;re transitioning from the private sector to progressive politics, you&#x2019;ll probably have a pay cut. You should note that you&#x2019;re open to this sort of pay cut.\nAs you navigate your way in this field, keep the ecosystem in mind. In general, when it comes to quality of life, advocacy organizations and consultants will offer higher salaries and quality of life than a campaign. The tradeoff is that you won&#x2019;t get the sense of mission, network, or, frankly, adrenaline rush that you would from a campaign. You will, however, still have a job after election day, which can be a non-trivial consideration.\n"},"content/02c_avoid.html":{"url":"content/02c_avoid.html","title":"What to Avoid","summary":"You’re a Republican mole.

A &quot;Junior Analyst&quot; somewhere might be an &#x201C;Associate&#x201D; elsewhere. A &#x201C;Data Scientist&#x201D; at one organization will be a &#x201C;Senior Analyst&#x201D; somewhere else and might be a &#x201C;Targeting Director&#x201D; at another organization. Don&#x2019;t be seduced by fancy-sounding titles: whether you stay in this industry or move to another industry, your skill and responsibilities will always be more important than your title.\nAnother thing to keep in mind: people are generally bad at writing job descriptions (in this industry or otherwise). As long as you have over 30% of the technical skills that are listed as required and feel like you could pick up the rest within six months, throw your hat in the ring.\nWriting a Strong Resume and Cover Letter\nYour resume should be a one-page summary of your skills and experience.1 You will not typically need to change your resume within a given industry, but you may need to tailor your resume across industries. Your resume should include the following information (though not necessarily in this order):\n\nBasic Information: Full name, current location, e-mail address, phone number, and (if you have them) personal website or GitHub account.\nEducation: Institution and date of degree. If you are less than four years out of school or this is your first job in the field, you may also want to include relevant coursework (not every course you&apos;ve ever taken on American politics).\nWork Experience: Any jobs that you&#x2019;ve held in reverse-chronological order. List key duties, projects, and tools used. Jobs that are less relevant can be summarized more quickly\nCampaign Experience: Any campaign experience will be useful for breaking into this industry, even if all you did was volunteer to register voters at your college campus. If you don&#x2019;t have campaign experience, volunteer on one to do literally anything.2\nTechnical Skills: List languages that you know in order of relevance and comfort, e.g., statistical packages first, and list those in the order in which you&#x2019;re most comfortable. Also list tools or software that you know in order of relevance and comfort.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to write a cover letter, take advantage of it. A cover letter is your opportunity to demonstrate your interest in this field and your desire to fulfill the specific role in question. Typically, the hiring manager will read your resume first and then address any remaining questions in the cover letter. You need to make sure that the cover letter address why you want this job and why the company should want you: \n\nClearly demonstrate your fit for the role. Read the job description, and find examples of your work that fulfill the job description. If you are barely changing the cover letter across different organizations, you are doing something wrong.\n\nResearch the organization and mention them, by name, in the cover letter. They will probably have some sort of mission statement. Understand it, internalize it, and succinctly describe why you are passionate about it. If you are not passionate about it, or some other component of the job, do you really want to work this job?\n\nDemonstrate your interest in progressive politics. You need to be explicit about the fact that you want to work in this field. If you&#x2019;ve worked on campaigns before, mention it. If there are issues that animate you, describe them. If you had an epiphany about what you&#x2019;re doing with your life, describe it.\n\n\nYour cover letter should typically be no more than one page long, and make sure that you proofread it. After all, if you can&#x2019;t get a cover letter right, how do we know you&#x2019;ll get the analysis right?\nGetting Your Application Read\n...also known as &quot;hustling.&quot; \nPeople are busy in this field, and although they might seem brusque or rude, they don&#x2019;t generally mean to be. But it does mean that if you don&#x2019;t have connections to this industry or if your resume isn&#x2019;t an obvious fit, you want to work extra-hard to make sure that your resume gets read: \n\nDo you know someone where you are applying? Have them forward your email to the hiring manager, HR department, or to someone with hiring. This can help get it to the top of piles of resumes and that someone internally has recommended you.\n\nDo you know someone who knows somewhere where you are applying? Dig deep in your networks: your professors, your college classmates, your roommates may all know someone in this field. Get them to help you (and pay it forward later).\n\nDo NOT call the organization, campaign, or company or any members of the hiring team outside of the normal hiring process. That&#x2019;s pretty weird and will be viewed negatively. \n\n\n\n1. If you want to submit a CV, that&apos;s fine, but it may connote that you&apos;re not serious about a non-academic career. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2.

(In fact, this practice is so popular that you should probably be suspicious of organizations that don&#x2019;t require them.)\nThese assessments range in length from hours to days (though usually no more than a week). Typically, you&#x2019;ll receive some dataset, be asked to do some type of analysis, and then report your results. You&#x2019;ll usually have to send along your code and any additional sources used. This is an opportunity to you to show off your technical skills and understand more about types of skills you&apos;ll need or learn on the job. If you hate the experience of taking the technical assessment, you may not like the job.\nBefore you receive the assessment, ask the organization how long they expect it will take, how large the dataset will be, whether there are any specific tools that you will need, and whom you should e-mail with questions.\nThe organization you&#x2019;re applying for probably has a preferred coding language. See if they list it in their instructions or the job description; if it&#x2019;s not listed, just email them and ask. If possible, use their preferred language.1 If you&apos;re not terribly familiar with it, feel free to note that this is one of the first times you&#x2019;ve used it and are generally more comfortable in something else.\nAs you&#x2019;re taking the assessment, make sure you read and follow instructions carefully. The most successful analysts are detail-oriented, and these tests often include obnoxiously specific instructions as a way of testing how detail-oriented you are. Take particular note of how you are meant to display your results or return your task. If they want a PDF, send a PDF, etc. Try to avoid spelling mistakes, and keep your coding style consistent.\nIf there is some part of the assessment that you don&#x2019;t understand, ask questions. \nKeep an eye on the clock as you move through the exam. Try to set guidelines at the beginning for how long things will take, and if you&#x2019;re exceeding those limits, watch out. Typically, things take longer than you expect, and many of these exams aren&#x2019;t designed to be completed well within the specified time limit. That&#x2019;s because things move fast in politics, and people want to know how far you can get in high-pressured, timed situations.2 If you are unable to finish the exam (which probably happens to a lot of candidates, even the ones who are hired), include how you would have approached the question if you had more time. Honestly, you should give a conceptual overview of your approach even if you do have time to execute it. Most people won&#x2019;t actually read through every line of your code, so document things thoroughly.\nFinally, Google things. Your task will almost certainly involve something that you don&#x2019;t already know how to do, but good tests will be designed so that most of your solutions can be found using Google.\n\n1. As in, pick up a tutorial and spend a day learning something. Unless it&apos;s a really obscure language, it won&apos;t be a waste of time. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2. People disagree on whether it&#x2019;s better to do one part of the test well or to do a shoddy job overall.

One of the three things will happen: you get an offer (yay!), you don&apos;t receive an offer, or you don&apos;t hear back at all. We&apos;ll start with the infuriating response and work our way through the rest.\nYou Never Hear Back\nSadly, this is not unusual. Political organizations are often run by young people who are working crazy hours on low pay, and everything will be over by Election Day. Management practices aren&#x2019;t necessarily the top priorities at these places, so don&#x2019;t be too put off by a slow response time. It doesn&#x2019;t mean you got rejected. It just means...they don&#x2019;t have a decision. Or they do but forgot to share it with you. Or someone has a cold. Or someone quit and now their HR process is a mess. Anything could have happened.\nHere&#x2019;s what to do:\n\nAfter two weeks have passed since you expected your next interaction, reach back out to your contacts at the organization (HR person, interviewer, etc.).\nAfter another two weeks pass, reach out again.\nAfter another two weeks pass, try one last time.\n\nIf you don&#x2019;t have a response six weeks after you expected, then you were probably rejected.\nYou Were Rejected\nGetting rejected hurts, but it&#x2019;s not the end of the world. \nThe first thing you should remember is that a rejection isn&#x2019;t personal, and it could happen for any number of reasons, e.g., they miscalculated budget and hired no one; they couldn&#x2019;t settle on hiring criteria, so people just chose the lowest-common denominator candidate; they realized they needed a different set of skills than what they advertised before; there was some inside candidate that you didn&#x2019;t know about.1 Some of these jobs will have 500 applicants for a single position, so don&#x2019;t feel too bad if you don&#x2019;t get the offer.\nThe second thing you should do is try to figure out whether you had problems in your hard skills or soft skills. Unfortunately, people are scared of legal action, so no one with whom you applied for a job is going to be willing to give you a feedback. Your best case scenario is to try to casually ask for feedback over drinks, but that still might not work. Another thing you can try doing is asking a friend to take a look over your entire application and give you any feedback.\nIf you think the issue is with hard skills, then check out the section below and work on them. If the issue is with soft skills, then grab your best friend and ask them for some hard truths about the way you come off in a professional setting. Here are some adjectives you&#x2019;ll want to avoid: nervous, condescending, shy, quiet, not a self-starter, slow. \nThe third thing you should do is wait six months and apply again. Write about the new skills and experiences you&#x2019;ve gained in your cover letter. Try to reach back out to any contacts you made the first time around and reaffirm your interest.\nYou Got an Offer!\nWhoohoo, congrats! Now you actually need to decide whether you want to work there. Hopefully, you have a decent amount of information from the hiring process itself, but you should still take the opportunity to get more. Especially now that they&apos;ve made you an offer, you really want to take the opportunity to learn as much as possible about what you&apos;re walking into. Having someone quit within the first 90 days is a waste of time for you and the organization.\nThe best thing you can do is try to get a conversation with someone off-the-record. Off-the-record means stalking the organization to see if some guy you went to high school with is there. Or recently left. Ask your friends, and ask your friends to ask their friends. \nIf you go through official channels, ask if you can speak to someone who occupies the position you applied for. Your interviewers are probably at the level above that, but if you speak to a future peer, you&#x2019;ll get a better sense of what life is actually like.\nAlso, learn to read between the lines. No one will ever tell you that an organization is a dysfunctional disaster, but if you speak to multiple people on multiple days and you still can&#x2019;t get any sense of some enthusiasm, then you should be wary.\nSome questions that are good to ask:\n\nWhat is the best part of the job? What is the worst part of the job? If you could change one thing about the job or organization, what would you change?\n\nThinking ahead to the next year, what are the biggest challenges that this organization is facing?\n\nWhat is the work-life balance typically like? When are people typically in the office?2\n\nTell me about the people who have been in this position before. How long did they stay at the organization?3 Where have they ended up?4 Politics has a higher than average turnover, but you&apos;re generally looking for a place where analysts can grow.\n\nTypically, what are some of the challenges that someone in my role will face?\n\nHow do you evaluate performance?\n\nWhat kind of professional development opportunities do you offer?\n\nWhat type of mentoring is typical? You should really push hard here for examples of mentorship. Everyone will say that there is mentorship5, but your interviewers should be able to name specific, concrete examples.\n\nIs this position expected to last past the election?\n\n\n\n1. There are more nefarious reasons. Harassment and discrimination exist, even in progressive politics. If you feel you&#x2019;ve been discriminated against because your membership in a protected class, seek legal counsel. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2. You should expect people to say they&#x2019;re in the office at least 40-50 hours a week during the &quot;off-season&quot; and more during the heat of the cycle. Office hours will vary from organization to organization. &#x21A9;\n\n\n3. Politics has a higher than average turnover, so keep that in mind. People staying less than 18 months might be a red flag (but isn&#x2019;t necessarily one). &#x21A9;\n\n\n4. If past analysts are now at larger organizations with obvious promotions, then you&#x2019;re probably fine. If they&#x2019;ve disappeared from the industry or only made lateral moves, that&#x2019;s probably bad. If their analysts have been around but haven&#x2019;t been promoted, then that&#x2019;s abnormal. In politics, if you have the same (junior) role for more than one or two cycles, you&#x2019;re probably doing something wrong. &#x21A9;\n\n\n5. Mentorship is a huge key to success and happiness, especially in this field, where everyone knows each other. There&#x2019;s a lot of information that will never be written down, and even if you&#x2019;re skilled and smart, you&#x2019;ll need someone who can explain the ropes to you. That said, most people in this field haven&#x2019;t learned formal management principles. Don&#x2019;t be put off if there&#x2019;s not a formal mentorship program.

Theoretical statistics is useful, as is knowledge of campaigns, but in order to be analyst, you need to know how to produce scalable, replicable work.1\nCore Skills\nA handy metric that for how well do you know something is &quot;how much Googling does it take for you to do something?&quot; \nCore skills are things that you should be able to get within 3 Googles or less, i.e., they&#x2019;re something that you&#x2019;re basically able to do off-the-cuff but might need some reminder on the details.\nNote: in the following section, when I refer to data or a dataset, you should picture something like an individual-level dataset where every row is an individual and the columns are things like first name, last name, gender, age, etc.\nData Munging\n\nData Input/Output (IO): read in data, export data, and transform data into different file types\n\nSubset to a part of the data by some condition, i.e. drop observations. For example, subset the dataset so that only women are left in it.\n\nClean up a messy column of data. For example, maybe a variable should be coded as 1 through 6, but there are 99s in the data. Could you recode all of the 99s to 0s or something?\n\nMerge datasets together based on an arbitrary number of columns and check to make sure that your merge worked correctly\n\nRecode columns from strings to numbers or vice versa\n\nGenerate new columns by combining old columns. Maybe this means you&#x2019;re multiplying two variables together, or you&#x2019;re going to create a new column that returns a TRUE/FALSE value for if you&#x2019;re a 65+ woman based on your age and gender columns\n\nReformat your data from wide to long format and vice versa\n\n\nBasic Analysis and Graphing\n\nPrint frequency counts of a column or multiple columns (i.e., print every unique value and the counts of those values)\n\nFind the mean, median, mode, and various percentiles of a column\n\nYou should know how to generate histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and line plots. Ideally, you should be able to generate plots that include multiple categories (i.e., scatterplot of age vs. income with different colors for men vs women).\n\nYou should be able to clean up your plots, i.e., label your axes, add titles, change colors, etc. \n\n\nCoding best practices\n\nDocument your code.3 Help your reader understand what you&apos;re trying to do. Your future self will thank you.\n\nFollow style guides. Google has quite lovely style guides for most major languages. Use them (or something similar).\n\nYou should understand the appropriate places for for loops and if/else statements.\n\nWrite DRY (Don&apos;t Repeat Yourself) code and use functions. A rule of thumb that&#x2019;s often used is that you can copy things twice, but once you&#x2019;re writing things three times, you should be wrapping it into a function.\n\n\nFinding Your Own Answers\nIf you only learn one thing in this programming section, let it be the ability to find your own answers.\nThere&#x2019;s this site called Let Me Google That For You. If your colleagues are sending you links from that site, things are very, very bad. If they&#x2019;re sending you links from Google directly, they&#x2019;re just being polite.\nAs a junior analyst, you&apos;re going to have lots of questions, and you need to figure out how to get answers to those questions without asking your boss or colleagues all the time. If you run into an error message, throw it into Google and see what pops out. There&#x2019;s an art to figuring out the key terms that you should be Googling, but the only way to learn it is to throw a bunch of stuff at the wall.\nIn general, here are some tips for debugging code/troubleshooting:\n\nDrop your error message right into Google or Stack Exchange.\n\nRemind yourself what the objective is. Abstract away from your specific problem and try to figure out the general principle of what you&#x2019;re trying to accomplish. Then, google that.\n\nWrite things down using pen and paper.\n\nBreak down your code and write small &quot;tests&quot;. Take a few lines at a time---is the output what you expect it is?\n\nCheck stupid syntax things. Are your commas in the right place, etc.?2\n\n\nCore Tools\nSQL\nBefore I get into other languages, I feel compelled to highlight Structured Query Language, or SQL (pronounced either &quot;si-kwel&quot; or saying the letters S-Q-L). SQL is how you interact with large databases, e.g. a voter file. As an analyst, you won&#x2019;t be doing a lot of data manipulation in SQL because SQL doesn&#x2019;t support statistics very well, but you will be using SQL heavily in order to access data. I sometimes joke that SQL is the lingua franca of progressive politics beacuse it&apos;s the one language that everyone from analysts to data managers to database engineers will actually know.\nHere are some basic things that you should expect to know how to do in SQL by the end of your first six months in this industry. It&#x2019;s okay not to know any of this going in, but SQL is pretty easy to learn if you know another programming language.\n\nSELECT statements to select data\n\nWHERE clauses to add conditions on the data that you select\n\nuse CASE WHEN statements because SQL doesn&#x2019;t believe in &quot;if&quot; statements\n\nJOINing tables together (and understand the difference between LEFT and INNER joins)\n\nHow to CREATE and DROP tables\n\nHow to GROUP BY a column and calculate aggregates\n\n\nGood tutorials include SQLZOO and w3 Schools.\nExcel\nIf SQL is the common language of progressive data, then Excel is the common tool. People will get snobby about Excel at times, but if you need to do a fast, simple analysis, then Excel is probably the best tool for you.\nHere are the basic things you should know how to do in Excel:\n\nINDEX-MATCH (old-school Excel whizzes will tell you to use VLOOKUP, but INDEX-MATCH is strictly superior)\n\nPivot Tables\n\nIF-Statements\n\nRemoving duplicates\n\nSUM and SUM-IF statements\n\nCONCATENATE strings together\n\nBasic graphing and data visualization\n\n\nI honestly haven&apos;t found great resources for Excel, but Chandoo looks pretty comprehensive.\nGeneral-Purpose Programming Languages\nYou should learn a general-purpose programming language like R or Python to be taken seriously.4 Yes, there will always be organizations who are willing to take a chance on folks who know nothing, but your search will be so much easier if you already know one of these languages. (If you stay in the industry long enough, odds are good that you&#x2019;ll end up learning both, so it doesn&#x2019;t really matter which one you learn first.)\nR\nDepending on whom you ask, R is either a wildly popular language for statistics or an awful language put together by statisticians who couldn&#x2019;t code their way out of a paper bag. R is built on matrices, so if you can keep that in your head, then you&#x2019;ll probably be fine. That said, R is definitely a more annoying language than Python for writing any type of software: managing dependencies and testing is way harder. (But as an entry-level analyst, these words don&#x2019;t need to mean much to you.)\nUseful packages to learn5:\n\ndplyr (for data munging)\n\nstats (for stats)\n\nggplot (for plotting)\n\n\nYou might want to download RStudio in addition to R, which will make your workspace a bit easier to manager.\nThere are lots of resources for learning R, but swirL, Code School, Roger Peng&#x2019;s Coursera course, David Robinson&#x2019;s RData course, and Functional Programming in R are my favorites.\nPython6\nPython is one of the most popular computing languages in the world, which is both good and bad. It&#x2019;s written by and for software developers, so it does lots of things easily that R struggles with (classes, testing, and virtual environments come to mind immediately). It&#x2019;s also arguably more (human-)readable than most languages: Python forces your code to look nice. That said, there are fewer statistical tools written in Python than R, so if you&#x2019;re working in analytics, you&#x2019;ll probably end up writing extensions from Python to R.\nUseful packages to learn:\n\npandas (for data-munging)\n\nnumpy (for math)\n\nstatsmodels (for stats/econometrics)\n\nscikit-learn (for machine learning)\n\nmatplotlib, seaborn, or ggplot (for plotting)\n\n\nYou should consider doing all of this in jupyter notebook, which ties together your code and visualizations nicely.\nLike R, there are lots of good resources for learning Python. Some of my favorites include Learn Python the Hard Way, Think Python, Python for Social Scientists, and A list of Python Tutorials for Social Scientists.\nA Note on Stata and SPSS\nIf you don&#x2019;t know Stata or SPSS, skip this section, and thank your statistics professors.\nStata is a statistical program used largely by economists and political scientists.7 It is not open-source, and a license costs thousands of dollars per year for organizations. As a result, it&#x2019;s an expensive investment for organizations, and, worse, many of the cutting-edge statistical algorithms/packages are no longer written in Stata. SPSS is also a proprietary statistical program and suffers from many of the same drawbacks as Stata.\nBecause Stata and SPSS are fundamentally designed to be programs and not languages (even if both have a scripting option), there are things that are literally impossible (or very, very difficult) in Stata or SPSS that are easy in R or Python, e.g., web-scraping, text analysis, network analysis, Bayesian modeling, and most of the topics listed below under advanced scripting.\nThat said, there are a number of strategy polling firms and even some analytics firms who still use Stata or SPSS. I wouldn&#x2019;t recommend taking time to learn either of them, but if you know them, they might be helpful. But you should realize that Stata is a poor signaling device. If you&#x2019;ve been a student (undergraduate or graduate) in the last 2-3 years and want to be serious about data analysis, then you need to learn something more--not just to get hired but to actually do the work.\nAdvanced Skills\nThese aren&#x2019;t skills that you need to have going in, but you have any one of them, they&#x2019;ll be useful. Make sure to highlight them in your resume. Many of them are skills that you should reasonably be expected to learn in 1-2 years, though. If the senior analysts at your organization don&#x2019;t have these types of skills, you should think seriously about how technical the organization is and how technical you want it to be.\nVersion Control\nCreate a GitHub account. Learn to use version control in the context of larger collaborative projects, i.e. using branching and merging.\ntryGit is a good tutorial.\nCommand Line Interfaces\nYou should be able to do basic things in the command line like move in and out of directories, find files, edit files on the command line (using either nano, vim, or emacs), move files, copy files, and delete files.\nMore advanced users should be able to do analysis and data munging on the command line using commands like awk. This is really useful when you&#x2019;re working with large files, where command line tools will enable you to work with larger datasets than can normally fit in memory.\nCode Academy has some great tutorials. For a more unorthodox approach, try Over the Wire Wargames, which teaches you command line tools by having you hack into servers.\nAdvanced Scripting\nAdvanced scripting is a pretty generic category, but here are some useful skills to learn: \n\nHow to write your own packages and modules. Regardless of what language you&#x2019;re working in, you will probably want to create some sort of centralized package that is used to distribute key functions.\n\nBash Scripting. Write programs that run off the command line! Really useful because it can mash together scripts from a bunch of different languages\n\nAPIs. You should understand how to hit APIs to gather information. If you want practice, the Sunlight Foundation has some particularly nice APIs with really fun datasets.\n\nWeb scraping. Take data from the internet and turn it into a machine-readable format by parsing HTML, XML, and JSON formats\n\nServer administration and database management. Ideally, you&#x2019;ll always work at an organization with an IT department and a Dev-Ops team. (They&#x2019;re like the black magic of technology organizations: no one really knows what they do, but they make things run.) In practice, you should know how to set up basic databases like SQLITE, Postgres, or MongoDB on your own. Amazon Web Services offers a 1-year free tier where you can play around on a server.\n\nWeb Development. Learn to make your own web-apps (perhaps on Heroku). Know your away around the basics of HTML/CSS (and for the love of God, don&#x2019;t reinvent the wheel. Just use Bootstrap)\n\n\nReporting and Advanced Graphing\nYour analysis is only useful if other people can understand it. And that often means producing lots of charts and graphs. Also, the extraordinary influx of data has meant that decision-makers like reports. Even when those reports are totally pointless. You&#x2019;ll still have to learn how to make them.\nWhen you do this stuff, though, you should be prepared to do this stuff over and over again. So...try to set up reports that can be updated easily.\nSome popular graphing tools:\n\nTableau is a pretty horrendous graphing package, but if you&#x2019;re a junior analyst, you probably have to deal with it anyway! There&#x2019;s a free version of Tableau that you can download. Play around with it for a day or two and build a dashboard. Then, slap it on your resume.8\n\nStatistical plotting in R or Python. In R, you can use the default graphics (often called &quot;Base R&quot;) or you can use the ggplot package. The ggplot package and syntax also exists in Python. Other options for Python include matplotlib and seaborn. Note that these tools are mostly used for static visualizations (the stuff that goes into reports and powerpoint decks).\n\nD3.js (Javascript). This is hard9 but potentially a worthwhile one to learn if you like data visualization and want to do much more of it. If you don&#x2019;t like data visualization, then don&#x2019;t bother. What&#x2019;s great about D3.js is that you can make interactive graphics. All of the cool charts in the New York Times, for example, are made in D3.js.\n\n\nMapping\nYou might consider mapping a subset of plotting, but maps are often particularly useful in politics in a way that&#x2019;s not true generally. Geography is so prominent in politics that being able to make a great-looking map is actually a non-trivial skill. \nHere are some things you might use for mapping: \n\nGoogle Fusion tables\n\nGIS (ARCGIS or QGIS)\n\nR or Python\n\nD3.js\n\n\n\n1. There are some organizations where you can get away with writing one-off pieces of code, but it likely means that the organization is inefficient. You should be striving to write good, clean code that can be used over and over again. But it&#x2019;s okay if you&#x2019;re starting off with one-off pieces of code, or if you&#x2019;re using that for prototypes. But eventually, if you want your work to be useful, it needs to be replicable and scaleable, so you should be asking yourself how to modify your code to accomplish that. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2. I can&#x2019;t tell you the number of times I&#x2019;ve gotten JavaScript code to work by chucking random commas everywhere. &#x21A9;\n\n\n3. Seriously, organizations have been known to automatically throw out candidates who don&#x2019;t add comments to their code. &#x21A9;\n\n\n4. Note that this advice applies to analytics in particular. If you&#x2019;re looking for a job as a data manager, then you probably won&#x2019;t need these particular programming languages, but many of the advanced programming skills will apply to you. &#x21A9;\n\n\n5. Really, anything by Hadley Wickham, who is a god among men. &#x21A9;\n\n\n6. At the risk of starting a flame war, learn Python 3 (not Python 2). Anaconda is a good installation. Jupyter notebooks are excellent for beginners. &#x21A9;\n\n\n7. If you want a career in social science academia, then Stata and SPSS may suffice for you. But if you&apos;re working at an organization that needs to do analysis at scale, you need to learn another language. &#x21A9;\n\n\n8. There&#x2019;s literally no such thing as a Tableau expert, so just fake it til you make it (or get promoted to the point where you never have to think about it again) &#x21A9;\n\n\n9. The way I like to describe D3.js to folks is through the Carl Sagan quote &quot;in order to make an apple pie, you must first create the universe.&quot; Well, in order to make a freaking scatterplot, you first need to decide the width of your plot, make your axes, map your data onto the axes, which gets mapped to the width of the plot, then add points, etc.  &#x21A9;\n\n"},"content/04b_stats.html":{"url":"content/04b_stats.html","title":"Statistics","summary":"Statistics is what separates analysts from data managers.

But statistics doesn&#x2019;t need to be scary, and you don&#x2019;t need a PhD to succeed in this industry. Below, I go over a few basic categories of statistical skills: inferential statistics, predictive modeling, and experimentation. \nDifferent organizations will have different requirements for core skills, and you should feel comfortable asking organizations what type of statistics are most useful for them. If the organization specializes in modeling, then you brush up on that, etc. As a junior analyst, you only need to understand inferential statistics, probably.\nInferential Statistics\nThis is the type of statistics that you should know from your basic Stats 101 class:\n\nMean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation\n\nHow to use T-Tests\n\nLinear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares)\n\nLogistic Regression\n\nInteraction Terms\n\n\nIf you need to brush up on stats, Khan Academy and Statistics One from Princeton are both pretty good primers.\n(Predictive) Modeling\nPredictive modeling is something that most social science or even statistics students will never work with. Usually, social scientists and other researchers use modeling for inference, i.e., trying to tease out substantive relationships between two or more variables. However, we can also use modeling for prediction. \nWhen you&#x2019;re trying to build a good predictive model, you don&#x2019;t care about things like coefficient interpretation. Your goal is to try to predict outcomes, and your model is evaluated by how well it predicts those outcomes through a number of different metrics. Your job is to pick the right metric and see if you can generate the right features (also known as covariates, independent variables, or x variables) to make those types of predictions. The actual value of the coefficients is meaningless. \nIf you want to have a job that involves building models, here are some basic concepts that you should know. These concepts aren&#x2019;t required for everyone who wants to work in analytics, and a lot of this will be learned on the job. But if you want to focus on modeling in particular, this is the stuff you should know. Especially at the junior levels, you won&#x2019;t need to understand the statistical theory or proofs behind this stuff, but you should know how to with apply them (perhaps with a lot of Googling):\n\nk-fold cross-validation and why it&#x2019;s superior to hold-out sets\n\nRegularization (especially LASSO and Ridge regression) and why it&#x2019;s useful\n\nKnow how to apply some standard machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting, random forest, LASSO/ridge/elastic net.\n\nBias-Variance tradeoff, why it matters, and how it applies to different algorithms\n\nAccuracy metrics: root mean squared error, AUCROC, precision, recall\n\n\nThe canonical intro textbook book on machine learning is the The Elements of Statistical Learning, but you don&apos;t have a strong background in math or computer science, I&apos;d actually reocmmend Statistical Learning, which is by the same authors but a little more accessible.\nExperimentation\nExperimentation is often the only way to answer the questions we care about most. Any time that you have a question along the lines of &quot;What is the impact or effect of X on Y?&quot;, that question ought to be answered with an experiment. In some cases, it won&#x2019;t be possible to answer it with an experiment, but in most cases, it will be answered by something that&#x2019;s not an experiment is therefore likely to be wrong.\nFor example, we might want to know the impact of getting canvassed--when someone knocks on your door---on voter turnout. You might be tempted to just let a campaign conduct its normal canvassing program and compare people who were successfully treated and those who weren&#x2019;t. But people who were reached might be different than others who weren&#x2019;t in ways other than just getting canvassed: for example, they might be older (so they&#x2019;re more likely to be home), or they&#x2019;re friendlier. These qualities (age, personality, etc.) can impact the outcome we&#x2019;re trying to measure (e.g., turnout), so we don&#x2019;t know if the difference between the two groups is due to differences in age/personality or because of the canvass itself. When you randomly assign people to get canvassed or not, by contrast, you can ensure that the only difference between the groups is the treatment itself. \nIf you understand the paragraph above, you probably know enough about experiments for most jobs. But if your role will focus on experimentation, you&#x2019;ll want a more sophisticated methodological understanding:\n\nA/B Testing\n\nIntent to Treat versus Treatment on Treated\n\nAverage Treatment Effect\n\nDifferential Attrition\n\n\nIntroduction to Program Evaluation by J-PAL is a painless way to learn the basics, but your real introduction should be Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation by Don Green and Alan Gerber.\n"},"content/04c_domain.html":{"url":"content/04c_domain.html","title":"Domain Knowledge","summary":"When it comes to domain knowledge of politics, you probably either know it or you don’t.

There&#x2019;s always more work than can possibly get done, and people will always want to get it done faster than you think is possible. Most of your colleagues are overworked, underpaid, lacking sleep, eating terrible food, and living at the office. While they may normally be wonderful people, a lot of campaign staffers become the worst versions of themselves during election season: stressed out, irritable, short-tempered, and otherwise unpleasant.\nI don&#x2019;t say this to damper your enthusiasm for working in progressive politics, but you need to understand that going in. In terms of your application, it&#x2019;s why having the hard skills won&#x2019;t be enough to actually succeed in this industry. Because election season is such a pressure cooker for everyone, it&#x2019;s important to assemble a team that can work well together even under those circumstances. This team will have to deliver an incredible quantity of results, and ideally, they&#x2019;ll do it without wanting to kill each other. \nIf you know all of the statistics and programming listed above, then you&#x2019;ll be a competent analyst. You&#x2019;ll probably even get a job. But without soft skills, you&#x2019;re never going to be excellent, people won&#x2019;t like you, and you&#x2019;re probably not going to be able to make the type of impact that you care about. This section describes some of the qualities you&#x2019;ll need to succeed in your role and the types of qualities you might be asked about in your interview. You&#x2019;ll note that many of these qualities aren&#x2019;t limited to progressive analytics, so they&#x2019;ll serve you well no matter where you go.\nBe Reliable\nAs an analyst, your number one priority should be to do all of your work reliably. That means that you produce excellent work and you do it on time. Million-dollar decisions may be made from your work. Your successes will rarely make the news, but a mistake might dominate national headlines. You want to be the person that your organization just trusts to get things done on time and accurately.\nThe first step is to understand the parameters of your assignment and to do that early. Whenever you get assigned a task, make sure you understand exactly what you need to do and when it needs to get done by. Here are some questions to ask whoever you assigned:\n\nWhen does this need to get done by? Is that an internal deadline or a hard deadline? Is that the deadline for a draft or for the reviewed version?1\n\nWhat outcome do you want and in what format? Are you looking for a table, a graph, a powerpoint presentation, an e-mail, etc.? \n\nWhen is a good time for you to review my work? 1 day in advance? 2 days? Who else should review my work?\n\nIs there anything in particular to watch out for?\n\nWho is this for? You or another audience?\n\n(Why am I doing this?) You&#x2019;re not necessarily advised to ask this question directly, but it&#x2019;s important that you understand why you&#x2019;re doing what you&#x2019;re doing. This is how you can check to see if you&#x2019;re actually accomplishing your objective. A good analyst will do what their boss tells them to do; a great analyst will do what their boss should have told them to do.\n\n\nOnce you figure out what you need to do, you need to figure out how to do it and whether there will be any obstacles. You should ask around on your team about whether anyone has done similar projects in the past, or if there&#x2019;s anyone with specialized knowledge that is helpful. Try to talk to them and review past projects. Once you&#x2019;ve got that figured out, make a plan:\n\nHow long will things take?\n\nWhat are each of the steps?\n\nWhat parts will be trickiest?\n\nDo you have all the data you need? Do you have all the code you need? \n\nDo you need to depend on other people to do things for you?\n\n\nAs you&#x2019;re making these plans, also make sure to keep your boss in the loop. Especially for the first couple of assignments or really any complicated assignments, reach out to your boss about what you&#x2019;re working on. Ask him or her to review drafts of your work (just make sure to indicate what is or is not a finished product). You&#x2019;ll almost certainly be doing something wrong---that&#x2019;s just a function of growing and learning. Your boss won&#x2019;t think you&#x2019;re dumb: conditional on making the mistake anyway, any boss would prefer that it gets corrected sooner rather than later.\nMake sure to keep your boss in the loop if timing changes. Often, you&#x2019;ll be working on one part of a larger project, and if your work isn&#x2019;t done, then that has downstream consequences. Yes, sometimes your work will be delayed for forces both within and outside your control, but when those times happen, your organization needs to be prepared to deal with it.\nLastly, don&#x2019;t panic about these things. There will be times when you are panicking. Those are the times when you need to force yourself to take a walk around the block or a one-minute dance break. Take a deep breath, step back from your work, and figure out what&#x2019;s going wrong. Then, think about what it will take to fix it. More people? More time? More tools? Tell your team what&#x2019;s happening, and they will be there to help you. You are never alone.\nLearn things for yourself\nOne function of working in politics is that you&#x2019;re never going to have the training or ramp-up time that you want. Stuff just needs to get done, and no one will have the time to explain to you in depth how to do something. At best, they might walk you through it once. Modal outcome is probably that someone throws a bunch of links and old code at you. Worst case scenario, you&#x2019;re just left to fend for yourself. Regardless of what happens, try to make the most of it. Being able to teach yourself things is an incredibly useful skill that will serve you well for the rest of your life. \n\nTake notes and ask questions when someone explains something to you. Time is valuable, and most people hate explaining things more than once. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask questions if people have the time. Most people like feeling smart, and they will like your sense of curiosity.\n\nUse Google. Give me Google, and I can move the world.\n\nUse friends and colleagues. Ask them questions, even if they work in other organizations or other industries.\n\nTeach others. If you want to really strengthen your skills, find opportunities to teach your colleagues or interns. It&#x2019;s the best way to find out whether or not you actually know something. \n\nLearn non-technical skills. Ask to go to meetings with other parts of the organizations or outside entities. The worst thing that happens is someone says no.2 Go talk to pollsters or field staff. Understand how the things you create are actually being used.\n\nChallenge yourself. If you already know how to do a certain function, Try doing it in another language. Look for new, better ways of doing something and then implement those changes at scale. Though, fair warning, if you really want to go down this route, you&#x2019;ll have to practice on your own. An average analyst will just do their job and learn on the job. An excellent one will learn outside of it as well. \n\nOptimize on skills that are both interesting and useful. Your boss or other mentors can help you figure out what&#x2019;s most important to learn. Don&#x2019;t be afraid to abandon things that you hate. If you get too good at something, you might be obligated to do it forever.\n\n\nCommunicate clearly\nI&#x2019;m referring to two types of communications here: technical communication and non-technical communication. Technical communication is when you talk to other technical people (note: your boss may not be one of these). Non-technical communication is when you talk to a field organizer or a client or otherwise people who have no idea what it is you did or why. These two audiences will require different forms of communication.\nWhen you&#x2019;re talking to technical folks, you should focus a little more on process because their primary objective is probably to check or audit your work. What did you do? What assumptions did you make? What alternatives did you consider but ultimately rule out?3 Anticipate questions and objections, and address them before they are raised. Your charts should be clear with titles and axes, your code should be commented, etc.\nWhen you&#x2019;re talking to non-technical folks, focus more on results than process. How does this piece of information relate to actionable outcomes? How does it change the program they would otherwise have run? How does it make their life easier? Avoid jargon. Don&#x2019;t be condescending. Be a translator. Visualizations and metaphors may be helpful.\nNo matter who you&#x2019;re talking to, be concise. Start with the results of your work and then, as necessary, go through process. You should always know why you&#x2019;re communicating something. Verbosity does not land well on campaigns, and it&#x2019;s often synonymous with condescension.\nAnd for the love of god, do not mansplain things. Given how hard it is for women (especially women who are now in senior roles) to enter and succeed in this industry, the average woman you encounter is likely in the top half of skill and knowledge in the industry. Don&#x2019;t assume that you somehow need to be extra clear just because someone has a high-pitched voice or looks young or is wearing a skirt; they probably know exactly what they&#x2019;re doing.\nBe Nice\nThis almost goes without saying, but be nice. Listen to other people. Don&#x2019;t interrupt. Keep an open mind. Be humble. Be patient. Be kind.\nYou may think you are the smartest person in the room. That might even be true. But that doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re the most important person in the room, or that anyone is obligated to listen to you, especially if you&#x2019;re being patronizing or confusing. (Sadly, the two are not quite separable at times.) \nDon&#x2019;t get me wrong--your work is important and helps other people do their work and make decisions. However, there are many other factors that go into decision making and you may not always be a party to them, especially when you&#x2019;re just starting your career. If things don&#x2019;t go your way, don&#x2019;t immediately panic or get upset. There are probably things going on that you&#x2019;re not aware of.\nFinally, be inclusive. You&#x2019;re part of a community now. If someone helped you with something, make sure to thank them and say their name out loud when you deliver results. If someone would be really awesome to be brought into a conversation, try to bring them in. And if you can help someone advance in their goals, do it.\nHave Integrity\nThe role of analyst is to provide ground truth. In practice, that means your job is to provide the best estimate of the truth that you can and to be explicit about the uncertainty and assumptions that go into that estimate. In order to do your job well, you have to do the right thing even when it&#x2019;s hard. There&#x2019;s something fundamentally different about the analyst&#x2019;s jobs versus a communications or policy person on a campaign: you can&#x2019;t change your tools or methods to support what someone else wants to think. \nEveryone working in analytics feels the temptation to say what other people want to hear, but that&#x2019;s different from what is right and from what is true. You need to have a sense of personal integrity because you will be tempted to believe that what your campaign is doing works and it will be easy to manipulate the data or results to fit that narrative. But your job is not to support narratives. Your job is to help people determine which narrative is actually the most plausible. In order to do that, you need to provide the truth.\n\n1. Seriously, if you&#x2019;re working on something and you can&#x2019;t immediately tell someone when it&#x2019;s due, then something has gone very wrong. &#x21A9;\n\n\n2. Although, to be perfectly honest, you do want to make sure you establish the reputation of being competent first. Otherwise, you&#x2019;ll just seem arrogant and presumptuous. &#x21A9;\n\n\n3. A quick note on humblebragging: I&#x2019;m not generally a fan, but it is important to make sure people know how awesome you are. One way to do that is, in the process of describing your work, talk briefly about things that were particularly tricky and show how you figured it out. &#x21A9;\n\n"},"content/05_conc.html":{"url":"content/05_conc.html","title":"Conclusion","summary":"Working in progressive analytics is going to be a crazy, stressful, amazing, awful, and awesome ride.

Do you have any advice for me?\nFor better or for worse, people have weird biases around PhD candidates/graduates. Some folks think that it&#x2019;s really great to have the additional academic training and a solid grounding in substantive theory. Other people will be worried that you can&#x2019;t respond to the fast pace of a campaign and are too theoretical to be useful. If you can, try to find out which camp your organization or interviewer falls into. \nNo matter what, try to frame your research and work in practical, not theoretical, terms. What is the value of the knowledge that you bring for campaigns? It&#x2019;s okay to say that there isn&#x2019;t a lot of practical value, but, in that case, what is the value of the skills that you bring?\nAs a PhD candidate, you&#x2019;ll be held to higher standards than other entry-level candidates, even if this is your first job out of school. You should be comfortable with a variety of statistical methods and know either Python or R. If you only know Stata, then take 2-3 months and learn another language. List that language first on your resume.\nIn your cover letter, be explicit about what you&#x2019;re looking for. Is it a job for the election cycle? A summer + fall semester job? Looking to leave academia?\nLast note: a lot of your future colleagues will be younger and less credentialed than you. Try not to be condescending.\nHow do I reach out to someone?\nThe progressive analytics community is generally pretty nice, and you should befriend other people in your field - senior, junior, etc. They may not be your mentor (or even your friend), but everyone likes talking about themselves and you shouldn&apos;t be afraid to ask someone to get a coffee/drink to just chat.\nThat said, you want to mindful of the fact that most people are busy, and their time is valuable. Don&#x2019;t reach out for the sake of reaching out. Is there a particular reason you want to reach out to that person? Do they have some experience that particularly interests you? Do your homework and have specific questions in mind. In general, you should plan on no more than a 20-30 minute conversation, and you should show up/call in on time.\nIn terms of contacting people, you will always be more successful if you go through someone you mutually know or if you can point out a common connection (e.g., college, high school, mutual interest, etc). But even if you don&#x2019;t have those, you are at least mutually interested in progressive politics! \nHere&#x2019;s a sample email for the initial contact that is polite, respectful, and brief:\n\nDear Jordan,\nMy name is Jenny, and I am a [role at organization or university]. I saw that you [how you know of this person], and I am interested in [why you want to talk to this person/why this person should care about you]. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about [topic of interest]. My resume is attached here. \nDo you have time for a short conversation the week of __? I am free [Monday 4-6 PM EST], [Tuesday 10 AM - 12 PM EST], or [Wednesday 5-7 PM EST]__.\nThanks,\nJenny\n\nFor example,\n\nDear Jordan,\nMy name is Jenny, and I am a senior at Babayaga University. I saw that you&#x2019;re working at EMILY&#x2019;s List, which I first learned of when I was a volunteer for Barbara Mikulski&#x2019;s campaign in 2010. I am interested in pursuing a career in progressive analytics, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about how you transitioned from field organizing to targeting. My resume is attached here. \nDo you have time for a short conversation the week of February 1st? I am free Monday 4-6 PM EST, Tuesday 9-11 AM EST, or Wednesday 5-7 PM EST.\nThanks,\nJenny\n\nIf you don&#x2019;t get a response to this email, it doesn&#x2019;t mean that this person doesn&#x2019;t like you. It&#x2019;s probably more likely that they&#x2019;re just busy.

You&#x2019;re entering a world of people who you won&#x2019;t be sure are crazy or brilliant or both. You are in for long days and short deadlines. You will meet some of your closest friends, and there will be times when you will want to strangle them out of stress and sleep-deprivation. Your job will be at turns tedious, overwhelming, and insanely hard. You will learn new skills out of necessity, and at multiple times during an election season, you will ask yourself, &quot;Who in their right mind is letting me doing this?&quot;1 Above all, you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you are using your skills and talent to make the world a better place, whether your passion is reducing racial and economic inequality, promoting women&#x2019;s rights, protecting the environment, advancing LGBTQ policies, defending communities of color, or something else entirely. Welcome, we&#x2019;re glad you&#x2019;re here. \nLike any field, the progressive analytics community comes with some unspoken norms and expectations. This guide is designed to help illuminate some of those and help you get your first job in progressive analytics, working either on campaigns, analytics departments, or consultancies.  We start with a very brief overview of what analytics is and who the major players are. Then, we dive into the components of the typical application process, and we conclude with an overview of the skills you&#x2019;ll need to succeed in your job search. We also include free, online resources to learn all of the basic skills. Finally, the ppendix includes a list of analytics organizations where you might want to start your search and a dictionary of jargon you might encounter.\nDisclaimer\nThis document was prepared by the author in her personal capacity.
