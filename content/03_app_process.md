# Application Process

Great, so you’ve decided that you want to work in progressive analytics! We’ve provided a list of organizations in the Appendix to kick off your search, but this section will go through the nitty-gritty of what your search will like entail.

As you go through the application process, I'd encourage you to keep [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor) in mind:

> Never assume malice when stupidity will suffice.

People in this industry are well-meaning, but they're overburdened and typically lack a human resources team. As a result, your hiring process may feel slow, insane, and annoying, but no one's actually out to get you. We all want to find talented people to work in this field; we're just not always that competent during the application process.
