# Application Process

Great, so you’ve decided that you want to work in progressive analytics! We’ve provided a [list of organizations](#heading=h.jphnuu4mop3t) in the Appendix to kick off your search, and this section will go through the nitty-gritty of what your search will like entail.

Here’s the first thing you should know: titles are meaningless. A "Junior Analyst" somewhere might be an “Associate” elsewhere. A “Data Scientist” at one organization will be a “Senior Analyst” somewhere else and might be a “Targeting Director” at another organization. Don’t be seduced by fancy-sounding titles: whether you stay in this industry or move to another industry, your skill and responsibilities will always be more important than your title.

Another thing to keep in mind: people are generally bad at writing job descriptions (in this industry or otherwise). As long as you have over 30% of the technical skills that are listed as required and feel like you could pick up the rest within six months, throw your hat in the ring.
