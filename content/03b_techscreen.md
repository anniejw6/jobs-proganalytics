## Nailing the Technical Screen

Once someone reviews your application, it’s become increasingly fashionable to require analysts to take technical assessments, often even before an interview is offered. (Indeed, this practice is so popular that you should probably be suspicious of organizations that don’t require them.)

These assessments range in length from hours to days (though usually no more than a week). Typically, you’ll receive some dataset, be asked to do some type of analysis, and then report your results. You’ll usually also have to send along your code and any additional sources used.

Before you receive the assessment, ask the organization how long they expect it will take, how large the dataset will be, whether there are any specific tools that you will need, and who you should e-mail with any questions if they arise. 

The organization you’re applying for probably has a preferred coding language. See if they list it in their instructions or the job description; if it’s not listed, it’s completely acceptable to just email them and ask. If it’s possible, try to use their preferred language. Even if you’re not terribly familiar with it, feel free to note that this is one of the first times you’ve used it and are generally more comfortable in something else.

As you’re taking the assessment, make sure you read and follow instructions carefully. The most successful analysts need to be detail-oriented, and these tests often include obnoxiously specific instructions as a way of testing how detail-oriented you are. Take particular note of how you are meant to display your results or return your task. If they want a PDF, send a PDF, etc. Try to avoid spelling mistakes, and keep your coding style consistent.

If there is some part of the assessment that you don’t understand, ask questions. 

Keep an eye on the clock as you move through the exam. Try to set guidelines at the beginning for how long things will take, and if you’re exceeding those limits, watch out. Typically, things take longer than you expect, and many of these exams aren’t designed to be completed well within the specified time limit. That’s because things move fast in politics, and people want to know how far you can get in high-pressured, timed situations. (NOTE:  There’s an open question as to whether it’s better to do one part of the test well or to do a shoddy job overall. Personally, I prefer people who try all parts, but you should go with your gut on this one.) If for some reason, you are unable to finish the exam, include how you would have conceptually approached the question if you had more time. Honestly, you should give a conceptual overview of your approach even if you *do *have time to execute it. Most people won’t actually read through every line of your code, and being a sufficiently good communicator to recognize that is important.

And finally, please Google questions. Your task will almost certainly involve something that you don’t already know how to do, but good tests will be designed so that most of your solutions can be found using Google.
