## What are some reasons to *avoid* this field?

1. **You’re a Republican mole.** Go away, mole.

2. **You want to be famous.** When you work on a campaign, the candidate is paramount. When you work at an advocacy organization, the issue is paramount. *You *don’t matter, and you may never receive the credit or pay you deserve. 

3. **You want a relaxed job that pays well.** Working in politics will involve long hours and low pay. You should be prepared for a stressful, fast-paced environment. It will be awesome--but it will be *hard*.
