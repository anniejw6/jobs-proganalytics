This section covers the basics of getting your application in front of the right people: how to write a good resume and cover letter, and how to make sure that they're read.

## Writing a Resume

Please submit a one-page resume, not a CV. It should include the following items (though not necessarily in this order): 

* Basic Information

    * Full Name

    * Current Location

    * E-mail Address

    * Phone Number

    * (If applicable) personal website or GitHub account

* Education

    * Institution and date of degree

    * Relevant coursework

        * Only include this is you are less than four years out of school (undergrad or grad) and this is your first job in the field

        * Include only the courses/topics that are directly relevant to the job

* Work Experience

    * Any jobs that you’ve held in reverse-chronological order

    * List key duties, projects, and tools used

    * Jobs that are less relevant can be summarized more quickly

* Campaign Experience

    * *Any *campaign experience --- even if all you did was volunteer to register voters at your college campus

    * If you don’t have campaign experience, volunteer on one to do literally anything (NOTE:  In fact, almost any volunteer activity as part of an organized effort will teach you skills to succeed in this industry. If you don’t have campaign activity but do have other forms of volunteer experience, put it in a separate section.)

* Technical skills

    * Languages that you know in order of relevance and comfort, e.g., statistical packages first, and list those in the order in which you’re most comfortable

    * Tools or software that you know in order of relevance and comfort

## Writing a Cover Letter

If you have the opportunity to write a cover letter, write one. Some organizations won’t require it and others will outright prohibit it. But if you can, I would include one, especially if you’re transitioning into political analytics. A cover letter is your opportunity to demonstrate your interest in the field and your desire to fulfill that specific role. A good way to think about your application is to think of the hiring manager reading your resume first and then addressing any questions they still have in the cover letter. And in light of that---proofread your cover letter and ask a friend to do the same. If you can’t get a cover letter right, how do we know you’ll get the analysis right?

Here are some things your cover letter should include:

* **Clearly demonstrate why you’re well-suited to the specific role. **Read the job description, find examples of your work that fulfill the job description. If you are writing the same body paragraphs for every cover letter that you send out, you are doing something wrong.

* **Research the organization**** and mention them, by name, in the cover letter****. **They will probably have some sort of mission statement. Understand it, internalize it, and succinctly describe why you are passionate about it. If you are not passionate about it, or some other component of the job, you probably don’t want this job, and you will be miserable.

* **D****emonstrate your interest in progressive politics. **You need to be explicit about the fact that you want to work in this field. If you’ve worked on campaigns before, mention it. If there are issues that animate you, describe them. If you had an epiphany about what you’re doing with your life, describe it in two sentences or less. 

Please also note that your cover letter should be no more than one page long.

## Getting Your Application Read

...also known as "hustling." 

People are busy in this field, and although they might seem brusque or rude, they don’t generally mean to be. But it does mean that if you don’t have connections to this industry or if your resume isn’t an obvious fit, you want to work extra-hard to make sure that your resume gets read: 

* **Do you know someone where you are applying? **Have them forward your email to the hiring manager, HR department, or to someone with hiring. This can help get it to the top of piles of resumes and that someone internally has recommended you.

* **Do you know someone who knows somewhere where you are applying? **Dig deep in your networks: your professors, your college classmates, your roommates may all know someone in this field. Get them to help you (and pay it forward later).

* **Do NOT call the organization, campaign, or company **or any members of the hiring team outside of the normal hiring process. That’s pretty weird and will be viewed negatively.
