# Frequently Asked Questions

#### I am in/have recently graduated from a PhD program. Do you have any advice for me?

For better or for worse, people have weird biases around PhD candidates/graduates. Some folks think that it’s really great to have the additional academic training and a solid grounding in substantive theory. Other people will be worried that you can’t respond to the fast pace of a campaign and are too theoretical to be useful. If you can, try to find out which camp your organization or interviewer falls into. 

No matter what, try to frame your research and work in practical, not theoretical, terms. What is the value of the knowledge that you bring for campaigns? It’s okay to say that there isn’t a lot of practical value, but, in that case, what is the value of the skills that you bring?

As a PhD candidate, you’ll be held to higher standards than other entry-level candidates, even if this is your first job out of school. You should be comfortable with a variety of statistical methods and know either Python or R. If you only know Stata, then take 2-3 months and learn another language. List that language first on your resume.

In your cover letter, be explicit about what you’re looking for. Is it a job for the election cycle? A summer + fall semester job? Looking to leave academia?

Last note: a lot of your future colleagues will be younger and less credentialed than you. Try not to be condescending.

#### How do I reach out to someone?

The progressive analytics community is generally pretty nice, and you should befriend other people in your field - senior, junior, etc. They may not be your mentor (or even your friend), but everyone likes talking about themselves and you shouldn't be afraid to ask someone to get a coffee/drink to just chat.

That said, you want to mindful of the fact that most people are busy, and their time is valuable. Don’t reach out for the sake of reaching out. Is there a particular reason you want to reach out to that person? Do they have some experience that particularly interests you? Do your homework and have specific questions in mind. In general, you should plan on no more than a 20-30 minute conversation, and you should show up/call in *on time.*

In terms of contacting people, you will always be more successful if you go through someone you mutually know or if you can point out a common connection (e.g., college, high school, mutual interest, etc). But even if you don’t have those, you are at least mutually interested in progressive politics! 

Here’s a sample email for the initial contact that is polite, respectful, and *brief*:

> Dear Jordan,
>
> My name is Jenny, and I am a __[role at organization or university]__. I saw that you __[how you know of this person]__, and I am interested in __[why you want to talk to this person/why this person should care about you]__. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about __[topic of interest]__. My resume is attached here. 
>
> Do you have time for a short conversation the week of ____? I am free __[Monday 4-6 PM EST]__, __[Tuesday 10 AM - 12 PM EST]__, or __[Wednesday 5-7 PM EST]__.
>
> Thanks,
>
> Jenny

For example,

> Dear Jordan,
>
> My name is Jenny, and I am a senior at Babayaga University. I saw that you’re working at EMILY’s List, which I first learned of when I was a volunteer for Barbara Mikulski’s campaign in 2010. I am interested in pursuing a career in progressive analytics, and I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about how you transitioned from field organizing to targeting. My resume is attached here. 
> 
> Do you have time for a short conversation the week of February 1st? I am free Monday 4-6 PM EST, Tuesday 9-11 AM EST, or Wednesday 5-7 PM EST.
> 
> Thanks,
> 
> Jenny

If you don’t get a response to this email, it doesn’t mean that this person doesn’t like you. It’s probably more likely that they’re just busy. At any rate, it can’t really hurt and can possibly help.
